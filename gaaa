Finally, to optimize the way how the road network should be reshaped, 
which roads need to be removed from network, proper optimization algorithm need to be selected. 
However, the simulation generated data sets are non-trivial and many traditional optimizing approaches may
 not find optimal solution. Genetic algorithm has been proven especially effective in such scenarios \cite{Pinninghoff}
 \cite{Krol}. 
It is a heuristic-based approach to find the best possible solutions. 
Idea of GA stems from the natural selection theory (Beasley et al, \cite{beas}) and countless studies 
such as Jong \cite{jong} and Tat and Tao \cite{TAT} have proven its efficiency in planning and optimization problems.
